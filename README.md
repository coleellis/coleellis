### ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cole.
- I study Computer Science and Chinese Language at Vanderbilt University.

ðŸ˜ƒ In the small bits of time I have outside the million things that are going on, I am currently prototyping an AI replica of J.A.R.V.I.S., beta-testing releases of iOS and iPadOS, and delving into the world of cybersecurity and penetration testing.

ðŸ˜­ Unfortunately a lot of my full-stack development is through my escape room designs which are all closed-source by contract.  I hope to someday have some open-source designs that I can broadcast to the world!

ðŸ¤” In the future I'm hoping to get myself via various cybersecurity examinations, but I'm gonna need God to add a few more hours to my day before I can work on that one.

ðŸŒ± My Top Skills Include:
1. Software Development
2. Cybersecurity
3. LaTeX Documentation
4. Math & Physics
5. Debugging code
