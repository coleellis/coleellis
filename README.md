### 👋 I'm Cole.
- I recently graduated from Vanderbilt University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.

😃 Currently, I am competing in various CTF competitions, building CTF and pen-testing challenges, and beta-testing iOS and iPadOS releases. I'm also exploring web and mobile development by completing a few projects I want to sell.

😭 I've built several guides for understanding command-line GDB and Radare2; I am actively expanding my Cyber Training Guide to include more low-level programming and networking information.

🤔 In the long term, I'd like to prepare for cybersecurity certifications and my Certified Personal Trainer license.
