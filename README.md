### üëã I'm Cole.
- I study Computer Science at Vanderbilt University.

üòÉ In the small bits of time I have outside the million things going on, I am competing in various CTF competitions, prototyping an AI replica of J.A.R.V.I.S., and beta-testing releases of iOS and iPadOS. I'm also exploring web and mobile development by completing a few projects I want to sell.

üò≠ I'm working on several tutorial guides for various topics, including low-level programming, CTF Competition Prep, and various framework tutorials (Radare2, GDB).

ü§î In the long term, I'd like to prepare for some cybersecurity certifications and my Certified Personal Trainer license.
